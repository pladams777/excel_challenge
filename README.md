# An Analysis of Kickstarter Theater Campaigns
A study of Kickstarter data to uncover trends in Crowdfunding Campaigns.
## Project Overview
With this project we are attempting to extract actionable information from a dataset of Kickstarter Campaigns. Our analysis will assist Louse, the playwright for "Fever", in determining her next step after running a successful campaign for her play. The goal of this analysis project is to provide Lousise with helpful information about how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analyzing Outcomes by Launch Date
The first trend we looked at was the Outcome of Theater Campaigns by Launch Date. The number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns were organized by the month the campaign began. Using a pivot table filtered on parent category and year, we are able to conclude what may be the ideal time to launch. Whether filtering by campaigns launched within a specific year or viewing every campaign at once we can see a similar pattern.

### Analyzing Outcomes Based on Goals
Next we reviewed Outcomes Based on Goals. We filtered the data to reflect only campaigns for **Plays**. We can use this information to draw conclusions about the affect the goal amount has on whether a campaign is successful. We divided the campaigns by a dollar-amount range of approximately $5000, to show the percentage of campaigns that were *Successful, Failed or Canceled* in each range.

### Challenges
The challenges in this analysis were mainly evaluator experience.
## Results
By evaluating Theater Outcomes by Launch Date, we can conclude that May-Jun is a good time to start a campaign. The successful campaigns tend to drop of in the fall and into the holidays. The Outcomes Based on goals chart tells us that the most successful campaigns have a goal of less than $5000.00.
### Limitations
This analysis is limited by the sample size and deficiencies in data measurements but reflects an accurate determination of the available data. Another indicator of success may be to analyze the affect Staff Picks and Spotlights have on a campaign's success.
