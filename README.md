# An Analysis of Kickstarter Theater Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Project Overview
With this project we are attempting to extract actionable information from a dataset of Kickstarter Campaigns. Our analysis will assist Louse, the playwright for "Fever", in determining her next step after running a successful campaign for her play. The goal of this analysis project is to provide Lousise with helpful information about how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analyzing Outcomes by Launch Date
The first trend we looked at was the Outcome of Theater Campaigns by Launch Date. The number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns were organized by the month the campaign began. Using a pivot table filtered on parent category and year, we are able to conclude what may be the ideal time to launch. Whether filtering by campaigns launched within a specific year or viewing every campaign at once we can see a similar pattern.

### Analyzing Outcomes Based on Goals
Next we reviewed Outcomes Based on Goals. We filtered the data to reflect only campaigns for **Plays**. We can use this information to draw conclusions about the affect the goal amount has on whether a campaign is successful. We divided the campaigns by a dollar-amount range of approximately $5000, to show the percentage of campaigns that were *Successful, Failed or Canceled* in each range.
